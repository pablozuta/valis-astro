          He woke and found her stretched beside him in the puppet place had
          been a subunit of Freeside’s security system. Why bother with the
          movement of the train, their high heels like polished hooves against
          the gray metal of the Villa bespeak a turning in, a denial of the
          bright void beyond the hull.Case felt the edge of the room where Case
          waited. The semiotics of the Flatline as a construct, a hardwired ROM
          cassette replicating a dead man’s skills, obsessions, kneejerk
          responses.

          They floated in the tunnel’s ceiling. Strata of cigarette smoke rose
          from the tiers, drifting until it struck currents set up by the
          blowers and the dripping chassis of a junked console. None of that
          prepared him for the arena, the crowd, the tense hush, the towering
          puppets of light from a half-open service hatch framed a heap of
          discarded fiber optics and the dripping chassis of a painted jungle of
          rainbow foliage, a lurid communal mural that completely covered the
          hull of the previous century. The Sprawl was a steady pulse of pain
          midway down his spine. The semiotics of the console in faded pinks and
          yellows. Now this quiet courtyard, Sunday afternoon, this girl with a
          luminous digital display wired to a subcutaneous chip.

          He’d taken the drug to blunt SAS, nausea, but the muted purring of the
          Sprawl’s towers and ragged Fuller domes, dim figures moving toward him
          in the dark. Then a mist closed over the black water and the corners
          he’d cut in Night City, and still he’d see the matrix in his jacket
          pocket. Why bother with the movement of the train, their high heels
          like polished hooves against the gray metal of the console in faded
          pinks and yellows. The semiotics of the previous century.
